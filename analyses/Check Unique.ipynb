      "Push and grind. Especially in lower years, think of the hardest you could possibly work, and then work harder. On both school and side projects. Getting a great first job is key, because it allows you to grow more than your peers. Combine that with always working on side projects, and you can get a great second job. Keep going, and you move into the top tier of your class. You start getting the best jobs much sooner - which allows you to come out of school with far more valuable experience than the people that loafted in first year. Obviously this is not always the case for everyone, but I found it to be absolutely the case with me and my friend group. Also go on exchange, it's the only time you'll ever get a 4 month vacation in any place you want with almost no responsibilities and opportunities to travel, meet cool people, and do awesome things.\n",

They are fundamental to your success, but are easy to overlook. Related to mental health, make friends outside of SE. It's easy to only talk to SE people, but you'll be much better adjusted having a diverse group of friends. And finally, school is important, but take breaks. You can't study all the time.\n",

Friends are life savers for class, especially when you skip often. Make sure you exercise and learn how to cook, these skills will last you a lifetime. Reading is so underrated, I wish I read more. Develop hobbies, these will help make time pass and keep you happy. \n",
